# SCAMOL: Structural Clustering and Modularity Optimization with Label Propagation

## Introduction

SCAMOL (Structural Clustering and Modularity Optimization with Label Propagation) is a novel framework designed to enhance community detection in large and complex networks. By integrating the SCAN algorithm with 2D Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Label Propagation, SCAMOL aims to automatically optimize parameters and improve clustering quality.

## Features

- **2D Gradient Descent:** Automatically optimizes $\epsilon$ (epsilon) and $\mu$ (mu) parameters for precise clustering.
- **Custom Loss Function:** Uses a modularity-based loss function to enhance clustering quality.
- **Label Propagation:** Effectively integrates hubs and outliers into clusters, improving robustness.
- **Scalability:** Efficiently handles large datasets without a disproportionate increase in computational resources or time.
